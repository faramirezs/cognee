# Active Context: Cognee

## Current Work Focus
- Memory bank initialization and documentation structuring
- Understanding the existing code structure and architecture
- Identifying system components and their relationships

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Established foundational understanding of Cognee's purpose and functionality

## Next Steps
- Review core modules and implementation details
- Understand the pipeline architecture in depth
- Explore evaluation metrics and performance benchmarks
- Investigate integration options with different LLM providers
- Review test cases and example implementations

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- How to best document the memory system architecture
- Understanding the trade-offs between different graph database backends
- Assessing the efficiency of current knowledge graph creation methods
- Determining best practices for memory querying and retrieval

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Async programming pattern is used throughout the codebase
- Modular design with separate components for extraction, cognify, and loading
- Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Clear separation between infrastructure and domain logic
- Preference for typed Python code with proper annotations

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Cognee uses an ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipeline pattern for processing data
- The system supports multiple graph database backends (Neo4j, Kuzu, etc.)
- Memory can be visualized using graph visualization tools
- The project has international support with documentation in multiple languages
- Memory can be queried using natural language search
- The codebase is designed to be extensible and customizable
