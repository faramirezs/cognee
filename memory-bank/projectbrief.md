# Project Brief: Cognee

## Overview
Cognee is a memory layer for AI agents and applications that enables building dynamic agent memory using scalable, modular ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipelines. It aims to provide a robust memory system for AI agents with minimal code implementation (advertised as "in 5 lines of code").

## Core Goals
1. Provide effective memory capabilities for AI agents and applications
2. Reduce hallucinations, developer effort, and cost in AI systems
3. Enable interconnection and retrieval of past conversations, documents, images, and audio transcriptions
4. Offer a simple API for integrating memory into AI applications
5. Support multiple data sources and databases with a unified interface

## Key Requirements
- Load data to graph and vector databases using Pydantic
- Manipulate data while ingesting from 30+ data sources
- Support for knowledge graph creation and visualization
- Query capabilities with semantic search across different data types
- Extensibility through modular design and pipelines
- Support for multiple graph database backends (Neo4j, Kuzu, etc.)

## Target Users
- AI researchers and developers
- Companies building AI agents and applications
- Open source contributors
- Data scientists working with language models and knowledge graphs

## Success Metrics
- Reduced hallucinations in AI agent responses
- Simplicity of integration (minimal lines of code)
- Performance and scalability with large datasets
- Community adoption and contribution
- Comprehensive testing and evaluation metrics
