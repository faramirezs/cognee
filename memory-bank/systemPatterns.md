# System Patterns: Cognee

## System Architecture
Cognee follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture designed around the Extract, Cognify, Load (ECL) paradigm:

```
[Data Sources] → [Extract] → [Cognify] → [Load] → [Query/Retrieval]
                                ↓
                        [Graph Visualization]
```

The system is built with asynchronous processing at its core, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets and complex operations.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Graph-Based Memory
Cognee uses knowledge graphs as the primary memory representation, storing entities and their relationships in a structured format that preserves context and enables complex queries. This approach addresses the limitations of simple vector databases that lose relational information.

### 2. Dual Storage Strategy
The system employs both graph databases and vector databases to enable efficient storage and retrieval:
- Graph databases (Neo4j, Kuzu) store structured relationship data
- Vector databases store embeddings for semantic search capabilities

### 3. Asynchronous Processing
All operations are implemented using async/await patterns in Python to optimize for I/O-bound operations and ensure scalability.

### 4. Modular Pipeline Architecture
Processing is organized into pipelines composed of discrete tasks that can be combined, customized, or replaced based on specific needs.

### 5. API-First Design
The external interface is designed for simplicity with high-level functions (add, cognify, search) that abstract away complexity while allowing for advanced customization.

## Design Patterns in Use

### 1. Pipeline Pattern
The core ECL process is implemented as a pipeline where data flows through sequential processing stages.

### 2. Adapter Pattern
Database interfaces use adapters to provide a uniform API regardless of the underlying database technology.

### 3. Factory Pattern
System components like database connections are created through factory methods that abstract away instantiation details.

### 4. Repository Pattern
Data access logic is encapsulated in repository classes that handle persistence concerns.

### 5. Strategy Pattern
Different implementations of core functions (chunking, embedding, etc.) can be swapped out based on configuration.

## Component Relationships

### Core Modules
- **API Layer**: Provides the main interface for users (add, cognify, search)
- **Pipeline System**: Manages task execution and data flow
- **Graph Engine**: Handles graph database operations and queries
- **Vector Engine**: Manages vector storage and similarity search
- **LLM Interface**: Connects to language models for text processing
- **Visualization**: Renders knowledge graphs for human inspection

### Data Flow
1. Raw data enters via the API layer
2. Data is processed through pipelines that extract meaningful content
3. LLM interfaces help transform content into structured knowledge
4. The knowledge is stored in both graph and vector databases
5. Queries retrieve information using both graph traversal and semantic search
6. Results can be visualized or returned as structured responses

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Memory Creation Path
`add() → classify_documents() → extract_chunks() → extract_graph() → add_data_points()`

### Memory Query Path
`search() → query_processing() → retrieve_context() → ranking() → result_formatting()`

### Graph Visualization Path
`visualize_graph() → get_graph_data() → format_visualization() → render_html()`
