# Product Context: Cognee

## Why Cognee Exists
Cognee exists to solve the critical problem of memory in AI systems. As AI agents become more advanced, they need a way to remember and leverage past knowledge and interactions. Traditional approaches to AI memory often involve simple vector databases that lose context and relationships between data points, leading to "hallucinations" or incorrect information retrieval. Cognee provides a more sophisticated memory solution using knowledge graphs to maintain relationships between entities and concepts.

## Problems Cognee Solves
1. **AI Hallucinations**: By providing contextual memory with relationship preservation, Cognee reduces the tendency of AI systems to generate incorrect information.
2. **Developer Complexity**: Traditional memory systems require complex integration; Cognee simplifies this with a minimal API (5 lines of code).
3. **Data Connectivity**: Most memory systems treat data as isolated chunks; Cognee connects related information in a knowledge graph.
4. **Multimodal Memory**: Many memory systems handle only text; Cognee supports conversations, documents, images, and audio transcriptions.
5. **Integration Overhead**: Implementing robust memory typically requires significant effort; Cognee streamlines this with modular ECL pipelines.
6. **Scalability**: Memory systems often struggle with large datasets; Cognee is designed for scalability.

## How It Should Work
1. **Extract**: Ingest data from various sources (text, images, audio) and prepare it for processing.
2. **Cognify**: Transform raw data into a knowledge graph with meaningful relationships between entities.
3. **Load**: Store the processed knowledge in both graph and vector databases for efficient retrieval.
4. **Query**: Allow developers to search the memory with natural language queries that leverage both semantic similarity and graph relationships.
5. **Visualize**: Provide graph visualization tools to understand the memory structure.

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture where each step can be customized or extended based on the specific requirements of the application.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simple Integration**: Developers should be able to implement Cognee in their applications with minimal code and configuration.
- **Transparent Operation**: The system should provide clear visibility into how memory is stored and retrieved.
- **Customizable**: Advanced users should be able to extend and customize the pipelines for their specific use cases.
- **Multimodal**: Users should be able to work with different types of data seamlessly.
- **Performant**: Memory operations should be fast enough for real-time applications.
- **Language Support**: The system should work well across multiple human languages.
- **Cross-platform**: Cognee should be deployable in various environments (cloud, local, containers).
